# 2018 MLB Game Stats

### Intro

Every game of the 2018 MLB season

Each game consist of it's own row with 161 data points attached to it

### Purpose

I'm using this repo to periodically practice common Data Science libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn)

At the moment the data is cleaned for analysis and I have some basic functions done. I'd like to create a report of the general statistics of the dataset.
